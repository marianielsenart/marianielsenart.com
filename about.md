I was born in Denmark in 1988. I have a multicultural background -  Scandinavian, English and Indian heritage. This, as well as living in Africa and traveling has had a huge impact on my work. Growing up in a creative environment where both my parents were artists has had a beneficial influence on my work.

I paint in order to understand my emotions and also to have an outlet for them, both the positive and the negative. This gives me a sense of freedom, so in fact I paint to feel free. For this reason my art is much more than just paint on a canvas, it is small bites of my thoughts and myself. 

I use many colours when I paint in order to properly depict and expose the many sides of human emotion. Also, I mainly paint female or feminine figures as my work is in part a self portrait as I perceive the world through my own femininity. I don't paint things that are perfect or flawless but things that become beautiful in their own right because of the emotion behind the work.
